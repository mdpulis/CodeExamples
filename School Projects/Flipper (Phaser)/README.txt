A rapid prototyping project created in the University of Utah's Master's of Entertainment Arts and Engineering
program with a small team in two and a half weeks.
Flipper is a lane management game inspired by Tapper with a few new additions like equipment switching and
busboys who clear all items coming back to the player.
I was responsible for implementing the busboys, the meter system, the fish bonus points, and general code
cleanup.

*You can play this game on my website!
