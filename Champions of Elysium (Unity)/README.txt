Champions of Elysium is a 3D RPG being developed in Unity that I have been leading.
It sets itself apart from other games with a unique one-button one-direction combat system that occurs in real time. Its dungeons also have a resource management mechanic which limits the number of items that can be used.
Many of the game's systems are complete but we are waiting on artwork to take the game further.
